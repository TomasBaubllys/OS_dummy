## Features

### Real Machine Model
- Processor simulation  
- Memory management: **user**, **supervisor**, **shared**, and **external** memory  
- I/O device simulation  
- Interrupt handling  
- Timer functionality  

### Virtual Machine Model
- Simplified processor simulation  
- Memory management with **paging**  
- Registers and command system including:  
  - Arithmetic commands  
  - Logic commands  
  - Control commands  
  - Memory commands  
  - I/O commands  

### Execution Model
- Ability to **load and run task files** with a defined structure (`#LOS ... #BYE`)  

## How to Run
- to run the program you can use one of the following commands:
  1. ```bash
      make

  2. ```bash
      bash run.sh
